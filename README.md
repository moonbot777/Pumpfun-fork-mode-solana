## üöÄ Features

- **Fully on-chain logic**  
  Token creation and Raydium deposits are handled entirely on-chain.

- **Presale/Sniping Support**  
  Enable a `Presale` phase before launch to support early snipers and initial price discovery.

- **Raydium & Meteora Migration**  
  Migrate token liquidity to Raydium or Meteora after curve completion with a single instruction.

- **Market Cap Oracle Integration**  
  Set a curve limit and use price oracles to calculate market cap in real-time during swaps.

# Set RPC
solana config set --url devnet

# Check balance and wallet
solana config get
solana balance

# Create a new keypair if needed
solana-keygen new

# Airdrop some test SOL (devnet)
solana airdrop 5
```

## üìÇ Project Setup

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/moonbot777/pumpfun-fork-smart-contract-solana.git

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Deploy

### Build the Program
```bash
# Build the Anchor program
anchor build

# Sync keypairs if needed
anchor keys sync

# After editing `lib.rs` (e.g., changing the program address), rebuild
anchor build
```

---

## Test Locally with Anchor

In `Anchor.toml`, set:
``` toml
[provider]
cluster = "Localnet"
```

Then run:
```bash
anchor test --provider.cluster Localnet
```

---

## Deploy to Devnet

In `Anchor.toml`:
```toml
[provider]
cluster = "https://api.devnet.solana.com"
```

Deploy:
```bash
anchor deploy
```

## üß™ CLI Usage

Use CLI scripts to interact with the deployed smart contract.

### 1. Initialize Configuration
```bash 
yarn script config
```

### 2. Launch a Token
```bash
yarn script launch
```

> _More CLI commands (swap, migrate, withdraw) are implemented in code but not exposed in the CLI entrypoint. If you want to use them, extend `cli/command.ts` accordingly._
